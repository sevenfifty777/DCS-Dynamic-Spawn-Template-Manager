# âœ… Ready to Build - Summary

## Your DynamicSpawnTemplateManager is ready for executable creation!

### What I've Done:

1. âœ… **Modified the script** to work with PyInstaller
   - Added `sys` import
   - Updated file path detection to work both as script and executable
   - Script now correctly finds `aircraft_inventory.lua` in both modes

2. âœ… **Created build files**:
   - `build_executable.bat` - One-click build script
   - `DynamicSpawnTemplateManager.spec` - PyInstaller configuration
   - `EXECUTABLE_HOWTO.md` - Simple instructions
   - `BUILD_README.md` - Detailed technical guide

3. âœ… **Tested** the script still works correctly

### Build It Now - Three Simple Steps:

```batch
1. Double-click: build_executable.bat
2. Wait for completion
3. Find your .exe in the dist folder
```

### After Building:

Your distribution package should contain:
- `DynamicSpawnTemplateManager.exe` (from dist folder)
- `aircraft_inventory.lua` (copy from current folder)

### Key Features Included in Executable:

- âœ¨ Modern dark theme GUI
- âœ¨ Two-step workflow (Options â†’ Templates)
- âœ¨ Airbase-centric template linking
- âœ¨ Coalition color-coding
- âœ¨ All DynSpawn options
- âœ¨ Automatic aircraft inventory copying
- âœ¨ No console window (clean GUI app)

### File Path Logic:

The script now uses smart path detection:
- **When running as script**: Uses script directory
- **When running as .exe**: Uses executable directory
- **Result**: `aircraft_inventory.lua` always found in the same folder

### Distribution:

Create a folder like this:
```
DynamicSpawnTemplateManager_v1.0/
â”œâ”€â”€ DynamicSpawnTemplateManager.exe
â”œâ”€â”€ aircraft_inventory.lua
â””â”€â”€ README.txt (optional - explain how to use)
```

Zip it and share!
